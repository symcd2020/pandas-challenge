Module 4 Challenge

I completed this assignment by referencing class acitivies, utilizing ChatGPT, AskBCS, and I asked a classmate 2 quick questions after if they ran into the same error I did. By chatting with my classmate about my error, we furthered our learning and realized that using groupby creates a series and with series you don't use [  ]. We both had fun researching and trying to figure out why the [ ] worked on previous code and not the current code. AskBSC reminded me to pay closer attention to my capitalization as that was throwing my error. I used ChatGPT to breakdown and explain lines of code to me to better understand exactly what I was doing.
